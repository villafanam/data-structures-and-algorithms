# Insert to Middle of an Array

Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We went with the most efficent approach where we use 2 arrays. The parameter array is use to fill the new array in the same for loop along with the new element in the middle.

- Big O
  - Time  --> O(n)
  - Space --> O(n)
