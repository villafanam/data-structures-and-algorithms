# Code Challenge: Class 30: Hash Table Implementation

Implement a Hashtable Class with these method:

+ set
  + Arguments: `key`, `value`
  + Returns: nothing
  + This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  + Should a given key already exist, replace its `value` from the value argument given to this method.

+ get
  + Arguments: `key`
  + Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

+ has
  + Arguments: `key`
  + Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

+ keys
  + Returns: Collection of keys

+ hash
  + Arguments: `key`
  + Returns: Index in the collection for that key
